You must complete all of these steps in order, otherwise it will not work.


Before you start, reset your camera to factory settings (these steps can be found in the manual)


1. Connecting (applies to all steps)
   1. Connect the camera as well as your computer via ethernet cable to configured (and connected to RoboRio) D-Link
   2. Connect camera to power source
1. DHCP
   1. Set ethernet cable IP address to 192.168.0.91 on the computer
   2. On the computer, enter the IP address of the camera into the website bar to view the live feed
      1. Since the camera is on factory settings, the IP will be 192.168.0.90
   1. System Options → Network → TCP/IP → Basic
   2. Under “IP Address Configuration”
   3. Click “Obtain IP address via DHCP”
   4. On the computer, set ethernet cable IP to obtain via DHCP
1. Naming the Camera
   1. In the configuration menu
      1. Setup → System Options → Network → TCP/IP → Advanced
      2. Under “Host Name Configuration”, click “Use host name:” and enter desired camera name
         1. It is advised to give your camera a unique name to your own team so as not to interfere with other teams’ codes (i.e. include your team number in it)
   1. In Bonjour
      1. Setup → System Options → Network → TCP/IP → Bonjour
      2. Enter the same desired camera name
1. Optional, Mac only: Testing the camera name via dns-sd -q (You still must be connected to RoboRio)
   1. On Mac
      1. Open Terminal
      2. Enter the following: dns-sd -q cameraName.local
      3. It should give you two IP addresses with cameraName.local.
