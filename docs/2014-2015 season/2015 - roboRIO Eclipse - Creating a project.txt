2015 - roboRIO + Eclipse - Creating a project

Open Eclipse
If prompted for workspace location, use the location of the git repo but the 'code/' directory below it. This will mean finding the FRCTeam1967/code/ folder.

New project
- File->New->Project... WPI Robot project (not example project)
- When prompted, give your project a name.
- Select Sample Robot (at some point we'll begin using Iterative robot)
- Prepare the new project by right-clicking on it and selecting Index->Rebuild

If you plan to replace the Robot.cpp sample file, you may find it under 'src' in the project and delete it entirely.

Setup INCLUDE files
- Use File Explorer or Finder (mac) and find the repository's 'include' folder. 
- Drag and drop the 'include' folder onto the Eclipse project just created.
- When prompted, select 'Link to files and folders' (PROJECT_LOC or WORKSPACE_LOC is fine)
- Now the include directory is part of the project - but not being used for include files yet.
- Right-click on the project and select 'Properties'
- Goto C/C++ General --> Paths/Symbols --> GNU C++
- Select at the top (All Configurations) ... not just DEBUG
- Then click 'Add...' and type /${ProjName}/include
- Be sure to select 'Is a Workspace Path'
- Click OK
- If prompted for a re-build of the index - select 'Yes'
- If not prompted for a re-build of the index, right-click on the project and select Index->Rebuild

Add necessary janky class files (.cpp implementation files)
- Use File Explorer or Finder to find an implementation file you wish to add to the project. Most likely these are located in FRCTeam1967/classes/*
- Drag and drop one or more .cpp files into the Eclipse project - into the 'src' folder
- Select 'Link to Files' and leave it as relative to PROJECT_LOC
- Click OK

Do one final index rebuild - right click on the project and select Index->Rebuild
Now build... Right click on the project and select 'Build project'
