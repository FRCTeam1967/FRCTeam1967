In order to use this example program, you need to downlaod some MIDI files,
convert them to CHRP files using Phoenix Tuner, and then save those CHRP files
to the src/main/deploy directory with the exact names.

To fetch the MIDI files, run the fetchMusic.sh script, which will download
the files to a midi directory.
