# This is the 2022 java folder

All projects should be in this folder.

Any new projects which are created will need to be "setup" for a proper Janky build.
After setting up your project:
1. File->Save Workspace As... (save the workspace file to the project folder)
2. Open a terminal window and `cd` into your new project folder.
3. Execute the following command: `../JanksterNewProjectSetup/setupNewProject.sh`
   This should modify both `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` for proper Janky building technique.
