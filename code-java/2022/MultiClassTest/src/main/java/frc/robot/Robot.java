/**
 * This is a sample program showing the use of the solenoid classes during operator control. Three
 * buttons from a joystick will be used to control two solenoids: One button to control the position
 * of a single solenoid and the other two buttons to control a double solenoid. Single solenoids can
 * either be on or off, such that the air diverted through them goes through either one channel or
 * the other. Double solenoids have three states: Off, Forward, and Reverse. Forward and Reverse
 * divert the air through the two channels and correspond to the on and off of a single solenoid,
 * but a double solenoid can also be "off", where the solenoid will remain in its default power off
 * state. Additionally, double solenoids take up two channels on your PCM whereas single solenoids
 * only take a single channel.
