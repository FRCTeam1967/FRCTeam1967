FRC Gyro sample program
--------------------------------

This is a sample showing the use of the Gyro sensor and the associated class for
driving in a straight line. It uses simple proportional control to steer the
robot during the autonomous period. There is no operator control portion of
this program, so the default action (print a message on the console) is taken
while the driver station is in teleop mode.
